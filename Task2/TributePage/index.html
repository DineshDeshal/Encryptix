            <div class="life-words">Narendra Damodardas Modi was born on 17 September 1950 to a Gujarati Hindu family of oil presser (Modh-Ghanchi) which is
            an Other Backward Class (OBC) category in Vadnagar, Mehsana district, Bombay State (present-day Gujarat). He was
            the third of six children born to Damodardas Mulchand Modi (c. 1915–1989) and Hiraben Modi (1923–2022).
            
            Modi had infrequently worked as a child in his father's tea business on the Vadnagar railway station platform, according
            to Modi and his neighbours.
            
            Modi completed his higher secondary education in Vadnagar in 1967; his teachers described him as an average student and
            a keen, gifted debater with an interest in theatre. He preferred playing larger-than-life characters in theatrical
            productions, which has influenced his political image.</div>

        <div class="life">Early Political Career</div>
        <div class="life-word">In June 1975, Prime Minister Indira Gandhi declared a state of emergency in India that lasted until 1977. During this
        period, known as "the Emergency", many of her political opponents were jailed and opposition groups were banned.
        Modi was appointed general secretary of the "Gujarat Lok Sangharsh Samiti", an RSS committee co-ordinating opposition to
        the Emergency in Gujarat. Shortly afterwards, the RSS was banned. Modi was forced to go underground in Gujarat and
        frequently travelled in disguise to avoid arrest, once dressing as a monk and once as a Sikh. He became involved in
        the printing of pamphlets opposing the government, sending them to Delhi and organising demonstrations. He was
        also involved with creating a network of safe houses for individuals who were wanted by the government, and in raising
        funds for political refugees and activists.During this period, Modi wrote a Gujarati-language book titled Sangharsh
        Ma Gujarat (In the Struggles of Gujarat), which describes events during the Emergency.While in this role, Modi
        met trade unionist and socialist activist George Fernandes and several other national political figures.
        
        Modi became an RSS sambhag pracharak (regional organiser) in 1978, overseeing activities in Surat and Vadodara, and in
        1979, he went to work for the RSS in Delhi, where he researched and wrote the RSS's history of the Emergency. Shortly
        after, he returned to Gujarat and in 1985, the RSS assigned him to the BJP. In 1987, Modi helped organise the BJP's
        campaign in the Ahmedabad municipal election, which the party won comfortably; according to biographers, Modi's planning
        was responsible for the win. After L. K. Advani became president of the BJP in 1986, the RSS decided to place
        its members in important positions within the party; Modi's work during the Ahmedabad election led to his selection for
        this role. Modi was elected organising secretary of the BJP's Gujarat unit later in 1987.</div>

            Chief Minister of Gujarat (2001–2014)

            <h2>Taking office</h2>
            <div class="cm2">In 2001, Keshubhai Patel's health was failing and the BJP lost a few state assembly seats in by-elections. Allegations
            of abuse of power, corruption and poor administration were made, and Patel's standing had been damaged by his
            administration's handling of the earthquake in Bhuj in 2001. The BJP national leadership sought a new
            candidate for the chief ministership, and Modi, who had expressed misgivings about Patel's administration, was chosen as
            a replacement. Advani did not want to ostracise Patel and was concerned about Modi's lack of experience in
            government. Modi declined an offer to become Patel's deputy chief minister, telling Advani and Atal Bihari Vajpayee he
            was "going to be fully responsible for Gujarat or not at all". On 3 October 2001, Modi replaced Patel as Chief Minister
            of Gujarat with the responsibility of preparing the BJP for the upcoming December 2002 election. On 7 October, Modi
            was sworn in and he entered the Gujarat state legislature on 24 February 2002 after winning a by-election in Rajkot
            II constituency, defeating Ashwin Mehta of the INC.</div>

        <h2>2002 Gujarat riots</h2>
        <div class="cm2">On 27 February 2002, a train with several hundred passengers burned near Godhra, killing approximately 60
        people. The train carried a large number of Hindu pilgrims who were returning from Ayodhya after a religious
        ceremony at the site of the demolished Babri Masjid. In a public statement, Modi said local Muslims were
        responsible for the incident.The next day, the Vishwa Hindu Parishad called for a bandh (general strike)
        across the state. Riots began during the bandh and anti-Muslim violence spread through Gujarat.
        The government's decision to move the bodies of the train victims from Godhra to Ahmedabad further inflamed the
        violence. The state government later stated 790 Muslims and 254 Hindus were killed during the riots;
        independent sources put the death toll at over 2,000, the vast majority of them Muslims.
        Approximately 150,000 people were driven to refugee camps. Numerous women and children were among the victims; the
        violence included mass rapes and mutilation of women.
        
        Scholars consider the Government of Gujarat to have been complicit in the riots, and it has received much
        criticism for its handling of the situation;[129] some scholars explicitly blame Modi.The Modi government
        imposed a curfew in 26 major cities, issued shoot-at-sight orders and called for the army to patrol the streets; these
        measures failed to prevent the violence from escalating. The president of the state unit of the BJP expressed
        support for the bandh despite such actions being illegal at the time.[9] State officials later prevented riot victims
        from leaving the refugee camps, which were often unable to meet the needs of those living there. Muslim victims of
        the riots were subjected to further discrimination when the state government announced their compensation would be half
        that offered to Hindu victims; this decision was later reversed after the issue was taken to court. During the
        riots, police officers often did not intervene in situations where they were able. Several scholars have
        described the violence as a pogrom and others have called it an example of state terrorism. According to
        Martha Nussbaum, "There is by now a broad consensus that the Gujarat violence was a form of ethnic cleansing, that in
        many ways it was premeditated, and that it was carried out with the complicity of the state government and officers of
        the law".</div>
        <h2>Later terms as Chief Minister</h2>
        <div class="cm2">
            Following the violence, calls for Modi to resign as chief minister were made from politicians within and outside the
            state, including leaders of Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam and the Telugu Desam Party—partners in the BJP-led National
            Democratic Alliance coalition—and opposition parties stalled Parliament over the issue. Modi submitted his
            resignation at the April 2002 BJP national executive meeting in Goa but it was not accepted.[149] Despite opposition
            from the election commissioner, who said a number of voters were still displaced, Modi succeeded in advancing the
            election to December 2002. In the election, the BJP won 127 seats in the 182-member assembly.[151] Modi made
            significant use of anti-Muslim rhetoric during his campaign, and the BJP profited from religious
            polarisation among voters. Modi framed the criticism of his government for human rights violations as an attack
            upon Gujarati pride, a strategy that led to the BJP winning 127 of the 182 seats—a two-thirds majority—in
            the state assembly. He won Maninagar constituency, defeating Congress candidate Yatin Oza. On 22 December
            2002, Modi was sworn in for a second term.
            
            During Modi's second term, the government's rhetoric shifted from Hindutva to Gujarat's economic
            development. He curtailed the influence of Sangh Parivar organisations such as Bharatiya Kisan Sangh (BKS)
            and Vishva Hindu Parishad (VHP). When the BKS staged a farmers' demonstration, Modi ordered the BKS's eviction from
            state-provided houses, and his decision to demolish 200 illegal temples in Gandhinagar deepened the rift with the
            VHP. Modi retained connections with some Hindu nationalists. He wrote a foreword to a 2014 textbook by
            Dinanath Batra, which made the unscientific claim that ancient India possessed technologies including test-tube
            babies.
            
            Modi's relationship with Muslims continued to attract criticism. Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee distanced himself,
            reaching out to North Indian Muslims before the 2004 Indian general election, following which, Vajpayee called the
            violence in Gujarat a reason for the BJP's electoral defeat and said it had been a mistake to leave Modi in office after
            the riots. Western nations also raised questions about Modi's relationship with Muslims: the US State
            Department barred him from entering the United States in accordance with the recommendations of that country's
            Commission on International Religious Freedom, the only person to be denied a US visa under this law. The
            UK and the European Union (EU) refused to admit Modi because of what they saw as his role in the riots. As Modi rose to
            prominence in India, the UK and the EU lifted their bans in October 2012 and March 2013, respectively, and
            after his election as prime minister in 2014, the US lifted its ban and invited him to Washington, D.C.

After the Bharatiya Janata Party-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) won a landslide in the 2014 Lok Sabha election,
Modi was sworn in as Prime Minister of India on 26 May 2014, becoming the first Indian PM to be born after the country's
independence from the British Empire in 1947. Modi's second term as PM began in 2019 following the NDA's 2019 Lok
Sabha election win. On 6 December 2020, he became the fourth-longest-serving Prime Minister of India and the
longest-serving non-Congress prime minister.



Modi addressing the Nation on the occasion of 74th Independence Day from the ramparts of Red Fort, in Delhi on 15 August
2020.
Modi's first year as PM saw significant centralisation of power. Modi, who initially lacked a majority in the
Rajya Sabha, the upper house of Indian Parliament, passed a number of ordinances to enact his policies, leading to
further centralisation of power. His administration enacted a bill to increase its control over the appointment of
judges and reducing that of the judiciary. In December 2014, he abolished the Planning Commission, replacing it with
the National Institution for Transforming India (NITI Aayog), concentrating the power previously with the
planning commission in the person of the PM. The Planning Commission had in previous years been
criticised for creating inefficiency in the government and of not fulfilling its role of improving social welfare but
since the economic liberalisation of the 1990s, it had been the major government body responsible for measures related
to social justice. In its first year of administration, the Modi government launched investigations through
the Intelligence Bureau into numerous civil society organisations and foreign non-governmental organisations (NGOs) on
the grounds these organisations were slowing economic growth. The investigations were criticised as a witch hunt.
International humanitarian aid organisation Medecins Sans Frontieres, and environmental nonprofit organisation Sierra
Club and Avaaz were among the groups that were investigated. Cases of sedition and terrorism laws were filed
against individuals who criticised the government. This led to discontent within the BJP about his style of
functioning and drew comparisons to the governing style of Indira Gandhi.

Modi repealed 1,200 obsolete laws in first three years as prime minister; 1,301 such laws had been repealed by previous
governments in the previous 64 years. Modi launched the Digital India programme with the goal of ensuring
government services are available electronically, build infrastructure to provide high-speed Internet access to rural
areas, boost manufacturing of electronic goods in the country, and promote digital literacy.

In 2019, a law to reserve 10 per cent of educational admission and government jobs for economically disadvantaged
individuals was passed. In 2016, Modi's administration launched the Ujjwala scheme to provide free liquefied
petroleum gas (LPG) connections to rural households. The scheme led to an additional 24% of Indian households having
access to LPG in 2019 as compared to 2014. In 2022, the government eliminated LPG subsidies for all citizens except
those covered by the Ujjwala program.

Since May 2023, ethnic tensions between some groups have resulted in violent clashes in Manipur. After 1 month of the
violence, nearly 100 were killed and more than 36,000 people were displaced. Modi has been criticised for his lack
of reaction towards the violence.
